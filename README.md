## Brief Introduction
- Federated learning is a new framework that is implemented for cross-device and cross-silo settings and works for both client-server and peer-to-peer based models
- In this technique, data is not imported to server rather it resides on local devices and on-device training happens. So, its main concern is preserving consumer's privacy.
- It can be merged with differential privacy and thus has potential to be robust to privacy concerns.
- The main goal is to deal with systems and statistical heterogeneity efficiently, which is main cause of concern in on-device training.
